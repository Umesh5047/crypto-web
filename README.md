# Crypto Web Assignments — React Project

This is a small React + Vite project scaffold to host and present "Crypto Web Assignments".  
It includes:
- A list view of assignments (from your Google Doc / local data)
- A detail view with code snippets and explanations
- Simple UI ready to deploy on GitHub + Vercel

## Quick start (locally)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. Preview the build locally:
   ```
   npm run preview
   ```

## Deploy to GitHub & Vercel
1. Create a GitHub repo and push this folder.
2. On Vercel: import the GitHub repo, choose the root folder, and Vercel will detect Vite.
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
3. Optionally set environment variables if you add APIs later.

## What I included
- `src/` React app with routing and components
- `public/index.html` base
- `package.json` for Vite
- `README.md` with instructions

If you want me to:
- connect to your Google Doc and import assignments automatically,
- add authentication,
- add interactive crypto demos (hashing, AES, RSA),
tell me and I'll extend the project.

— Enjoy!
